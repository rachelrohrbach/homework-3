# Credits
I consulted W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp), MDN Web Docs (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and Bootstrap 4 (https://getbootstrap.com/) extensively in creating my project. Some other resources that I used include: Stack Overflow (#https://stackoverflow.com/) and the GitLab repository for my course, specifically referencing the in-class activities.
